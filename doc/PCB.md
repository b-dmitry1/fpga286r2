# PCB
P-CAD 2006, Sprint Layout 6, and prepared for manufacturing Gerber files could be found in a "pcb" directory.

Technology:
* 4-layer PCB.
* 100x100 mm size.
* 0.2 mm min hole.
* 0.46 mm min via diameter.
* 0.127 mm min track.

I have paid only $7 for 5 PCBs on jlcpcb.com.
It is safe to increase hole size to 0.3 mm, via to 0.63mm, and track width to 0.15 mm.

All the electronic components including FPGA (EP4CE15F23C8N) and CPU (80c286) could be found on AliExpress.
