# SoundBlaster / Adlib emulation (incomplete)

* Dedicated RISC-V core (50 MHz, 8 KB RAM / RAM) for YM3812 emulation.
* The YM3812 firmware is written in C.

Emulation is very imprecise due to lack of documentaion on YM3812.

Digitized sound effects playback is not supported yet. Work is in progress.
