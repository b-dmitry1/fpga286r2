## BGA soldering

There are a lot of instructional videos around the internet about soldering BGAs. This requires some practice.
Doing this for the first time, I destroyed 2 expensive chips, but all the rest were fine. Usually, the procedure takes about 5 minutes.

1. Place the board on a constant-temperature heating table.
2. Add some highest-quality BGA flux on a BGA IC's place. I achieved the best results by applying a layer of 0.1-0.2 mm.
3. Very accurately and precisely put the FPGA IC on it's place on a board.
4. Set 210 °C target temperature and turn on the heater.
5. When the temperature hits 210 °C, add upper heat with 300 °C hot air gun.
6. Move the gun over the chip's top until the solder balls melt and the chip falls onto the board. Try not to overheat it!
7. Remove the gun and turn off the heater.
8. Wait until the board cools down to room temperature.
9. Check the soldering quality. The chip should be accurately aligned and landed on it's place.

If in doubt - please don't do it yourself! Instead, take it to a cellular phone repair workshop, they will be happy to help you for some reward!
